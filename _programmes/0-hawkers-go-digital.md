#### Taking your business into the future
NEA Hawker centres (including cooked food and market stalls), HDB coffee shops and JTC industrial canteens are an irreplaceable part of Singapore’s food culture—and always will be. 

To help our hawkers safely operate in the post-COVID future, we’ve lined up a few initiatives to get things started. 

#### Go contactless, go e-payment!
In these extraordinary times, maintaining public health and safety is a top priority. To help stallholders reduce physical contact with their customers, we encourage adoption of the SGQR <sup>[1](#1)</sup>, unified e-payment solution.

Enterprise Singapore (“ESG”) and the Infocomm Media Development Authority (“IMDA”) are partnering the Housing and Development Board (“HDB”), JTC Corporation (“JTC”) and National Environment Agency (“NEA”) to accelerate the roll-out of the Unified e-Payment Solution nationwide in HDB coffee shops, NEA hawker centres and JTC industrial canteens.

In this new phase of the initiative, stallholders will be encouraged to adopt a contactless payment option by adopting an unique SGQR label at their stall. By using a SGQR, stallholders will be able to receive payments through 19 different payment schemes, including DBS PayLah!, GrabPay and Singtel Dash.

There are also financial incentives in store for stallholders who come onboard the initiative. Existing Unified e-Payment Solution users and new sign-ups who adopt the solution by 31 Dec 2020 can look forward to an E-Payment Bonus of up to $1,500 ($300 per month, over a period of five months).

To encourage adoption, an E-Payment Bonus of up to $1,500 ($300 per month for any five months) will be given to all stallholders (both existing users and new sign-ups by 31 Dec 2020) who have demonstrated a sustained use of the e-payment solution.
This E-Payment Bonus will be paid when the stallholder has completed at least 20 transactions (of at least $1) in the previous month. Qualifying months will be June 2020 till May 2021.

#### How to sign up
Starting from June 2020, the SG Digital Office will be deploying a team of Digital Ambassadors to encourage stallholders in over 100 NEA hawker centres and markets, HDB coffee shops and JTC industrial canteens to adopt SGQR codes for e-payment. Keep a look out for our Digital Ambassadors!
